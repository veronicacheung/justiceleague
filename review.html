    <p><font color="black"><font size="+2">Overview <br>In short: It's awesome. The Flash and the Aquaman stole the show. There are so many moments in the movie that makes me want to cheer and clap (but people in the theatre are dead so I can't). Go see it you won't regret it.
<br>
<br>
Longer and More Detailed Review(Spoiler-Free!):
<br>
<br>
AWESOME STUFF:
<br>
-A (rather)vibrant, bright, happy movie, unlike BvS(DC has learnt their lesson)
<br>
-THE FINAL END-CREDIT SCENE IS MINDBLOWING(don't leave the cinema theres two end-credit scenes!)
<br>
-Keeps me very excited/worried guessing what would happen next
<br>
-Action scenes are epic, I don't care if its CGI. Stop whining people.
<br>
-The plot is pretty good, easy to understand.
<br>
-The villian doens't suck! I mean at least he is pretty hard to defeat so its fine
<br>
-Jokes are on point, especially the Flash's
<br>
-Aquaman is surprisingly awesome
<br>
-I can't say anything about supes though
<br>
-Yep, Batman and WonderWoman are swesome too. They are the leaders of the team.
<br>
<br>
âˆ´ The cast is like the best JL assemble you could ever encounter.
<br>
<br>
Erm bad stuff:
<br>
-I expect more characterization......That is a major thing since in Wonder Woman we can really see her growth and emotional changes, but in JL, the pace is really fast and the feelings are not well developed(But I mean its only a 2 hr action movie they cant put too much touchy scenes in it, right?)
<br>
-Feels kind of rush, again pace is fast(I have heard that the Warner Bros are trying to concentrate the movie into 120 minutes?!)
<br>
-Now i have wait for the Aquaman movie and JL2 for another solid 2 years.
<br>
<br>
In conclusion, it is a pretty epic movie. I like it very much. DC knows what they're doing. <br>A 8.8/10.
